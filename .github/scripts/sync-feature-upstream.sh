This repository is in the middle of a git merge with unresolved conflicts.

Context: this is a fork of ${UPSTREAM_REPO}. The current branch ${SYNC_BRANCH} is a sync branch
based on the fork feature branch ${FEATURE_BRANCH}, and it is merging upstream ${UPSTREAM_BRANCH}.
The feature branch carries the fork's own feature work; upstream keeps evolving.

Task:
1. Run \`git status\` and \`git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U\` to list the conflicted files.
2. Resolve every conflict. Preserve the feature branch behavior: where upstream refactored code
   that the feature touches, adapt the feature changes onto the new upstream structure/APIs
   instead of reverting upstream changes. Where both sides added code, keep both.
3. Stage each resolved file with \`git add <file>\`.
4. Verify your resolution compiles: detect the package manager from the lockfile
   (bun.lock -> bun, pnpm-lock.yaml -> pnpm, package-lock.json -> npm), install dependencies
   if needed, then run the typecheck or build for the affected packages only. Do not run the
   full test suite.
5. Do NOT create any commit. Do NOT run git merge --continue. Do NOT push. Leave the working
   tree with all conflicts resolved and staged, merge state intact.

Finally report: each conflicted file, how you resolved it, and the verification results.
